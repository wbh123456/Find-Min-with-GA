# Find-Min-with-GA
This program finds the minimum point of a function using Genetic Algorithm.
The program was built in 2015 and was just a experiment to test how Genetic Algorithm works.

#### Main Parameters Used:
  - selection_range --> The range of which the answer is generated
  - population --> Generation population
  - num_generations --> Number of generations going to evolve
  - mutation_rate --> The mutation rate of gene cross over

The .py file will create a svc file that records the best and average performance of each generation.
